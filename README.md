# Mac Setup
Some scripts to set up and keep your Mac dev machine up to date.

Create some private repo called `dotfiles` and clone it to your home folder.
This will be used to store conf files.

## To run the setup
1) [Comment out list of apps you don't want installed](restore/brew.sh)
2) run `. setup.sh`

## To create backups
1) run `. backup.sh`
