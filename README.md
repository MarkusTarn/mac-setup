# Mac Setup
Some scripts to set up and keep your Mac dev machine up to date.

Create some private repo called `dotfiles` and clone it to your home folder.
This will be used to store conf files.

## To run the setup
1) [Comment out list of apps you don't want installed](restore/brew.sh)
2) Check that setup.sh has execution rights `chmod +x setup.sh`
3) run `./setup.sh`

## To create backups
1) Check backup.sh has execution rights `chmod +x backup.sh`
2) run `./backup.sh`
